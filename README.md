# TELECOM CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION

Developed a predictive model to identify customer churn in a telecom dataset, aiming to help businesses proactively address retention issues. The project involved data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key features influencing churn, and implementing machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics, achieving high predictive accuracy. This solution provides actionable insights for customer retention strategies, targeting high-risk customer segments to reduce churn rates effectively.
